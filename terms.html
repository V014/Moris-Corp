            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <h3>For all services</h3>
            <p>1.1. These terms and conditions apply to all services provided by Morris to
                the client. They are deemed to be accepted by the client by virtue of
                the client accepting the quotation or by the client directly or indirectly
                requesting Morris to provide the services.
            </p>
            <p>1.2. No variation of these terms and conditions will be binding unless agreed
                in writing between the client and Morris.
            </p>
            <p>1.3. Morris's standard charges are based on the time spent on the
                client's job. The client agrees to pay Morris's charges at the rates
                current at the date of this quotation or as varied by Morris from time to time.
